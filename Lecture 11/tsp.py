    with dynamic programming approach.
    'current_min[s_index][j]' records the shortest distance from starting city,
    which is always 1, to city 'j' by visiting cities in subset 's' exactly once.
    's_index' is computed according to the combinatorial number system, thus dense
    indexed. And 'j' is sparsely ranged from 0 to 'num_of_cites', where only the
    ones can be used next iteration have meaningful values, otherwise zeros.
    'last_min' copys 'current_min' at the end of each iteration, so only needed
    values are stored. The base case for 'last_min[s_index][j]' is the edge distance
    from staring city, which is always 1, to every other city 'j'. Here 's_index'
    is a  dense index computed based on 1-element-comb from range(2, num_of_cities+1).
    After final iteration, 'last_min[0][2:]' contains all shortest distances from city
    1 to every other city(labeled as 2 to 'num_of_cities'), adding the edge distance
    from that city back to city 1 gives all the TSP distances. Note that the minimum
    TSP distance does not vary when staring city changes.
